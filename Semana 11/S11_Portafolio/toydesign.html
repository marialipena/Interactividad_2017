Amemi - Multiple Personality Disorder
<br>
<br>
Multiple Personality Disorder  is a condition wherein a person's identity is fragmented into two or more distinct personalities. Dissociative disorders are thought to primarily be caused by psychological trauma.
<br>
<br>
Amemi is known to have different masks each representing a different personality. Her body is covered in multiple faces, she has 6 in total. One can mean that she is a granny, another one that is a boy, and her actual personality that is girl.  She was abused as a small girl and did not have many friends growing up, this made her develop this world and characters with whom she has to live everyday.</p>

Bo - Social Anxiety Disorder
<br>
<br> 
Anxiety, everyone has it, it is a basic human condition. Everyone worries about something or everything. This plush toy is the characterization of what Anxiety means to me, how every single thing just goes around and around and around in circles in our minds, not pretty and perfectly drawn circles but circles of nervousness, worry and fear.
<br>
<br>
His name is Bo, he is afraid of saying something embarrassing, of being in social situations, and heights. He suffers from intense sweating and chest pains. Give him a little time to adjust and he will try and make the best out of his day even though it will scare him a lot. </p>

Illo - Tic Disorders
<br>
<br> 
At some point everyone experiences tic disorders. This movements often affect the eyelids, nose, neck and sometimes other parts of the body as well. Most of the time tics only last instances and are harmless to he person suffering from them. 
<br>
<br> 
Illo has the head just like that of a hammer. He can’t stop moving it. Whenever he feels nervous or in an awkward situation he will start blinking his eyes non-stop and jerking his head. One time he even broke down a wall because of this. Never make this little guy uncomfortable because it might hurt.</p>.

Nicoma - Relationship Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder

<br>
ROCD is when you have obsessive doubts and/or preoccupations regarding a romantic relationship or friendship. It consists in repeatedly thinking if he or she might be the right one, checking ones own feelings as well, comparing your friend or partner to others in terms of characteristics or behavior. 
<br>
<br> 
Nicoma suffers from ROCD, she has never had a stable relationship because she is never sure whether her partner loves her or not. She asks herself too everyday whether she does love him or not, in the end the answer is always yes even though the next day she will ask the same question.  She is a handful of love.</p>

Ocho - Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder

<br>
Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder is a type of mental illness in which a person has severe compulsions and obsessions with the need to repeat them over and over again.

This plush toy is my own personal immortalization of what OCD is to me.
<br>
<br> 
His name is Ocho which means Eight (8) in spanish, an even number, and he has eight white parts. He loves everything that comes in pairs of two. He hates his nose, mouth and belly button because he only has one of each. Every time he goes out he protects his hands, ears, legs and feet just in case they get dirty or catch something.</p>
