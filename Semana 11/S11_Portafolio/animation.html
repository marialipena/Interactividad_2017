<p id='p03'>I did this animation on my first semester as a second year student in Altos de Chavon, here I talk about depression and what it means to me; I named it "Depression Is...". The animation has a character named Lump, he is a little monster who for me lives inside all of us. In the video ‘Lump’ would act out the scenes as I would narrate. <br>
Later on we were ask to make another animation but toguether as a class while using our own styles. The theme was a road trip. So I decided I would make Lump go o an adventure while his littler friends follow him.</p>
