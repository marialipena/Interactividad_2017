  var0="The Bunch nace de la idea de crearle un personaje a cada desorden mental de la cual una persona puede llegar a padecer. Al igual que las personas estos peluches pasan por los mismos problemas que uno. Estos pueden llegar a tener depresión, ansiedad, tal vez sufran de pánico escénico, otro tal vez sea obsesivo compulsivo o incluso bipolar.<br> <br> Si estos peluches pueden admitir que tienen un problema tal vez esto nos haga entender que no estamos solos. <br> <h4> The Bunch </h4>"

  var1="ROCD is when you have obsessive doubts and/or preoccupations regarding a romantic relationship or friendship. It consists in repeatedly thinking if he or she might be the right one, checking ones own feelings as well, comparing your friend or partner to others in terms of characteristics or behavior. <br> <br> Nicoma suffers from ROCD, she has never had a stable relationship because she is never sure whether her partner loves her or not. She asks herself too everyday whether she does love him or not, in the end the answer is always yes even though the next day she will ask the same question.  She is a handful of love.  <br> <h4> Nicoma - Relationship Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder </h4>"

  var2="At some point everyone experiences tic disorders. This movements often affect the eyelids, nose, neck and sometimes other parts of the body as well. Most of the time tics only last instances and are harmless to he person suffering from them. <br> <br> Illo has the head just like that of a hammer. He can’t stop moving it. Whenever he feels nervous or in an awkward situation he will start blinking his eyes non-stop and jerking his head. One time he even broke down a wall because of this. Never make this little guy uncomfortable because it might hurt.<br> <h4> Illo - Tic Disorders </h4> "

  var3="  Anxiety, everyone has it, it is a basic human condition. Everyone worries about something or everything. This plush toy is the characterization of what Anxiety means to me, how every single thing just goes around and around and around in circles in our minds, not pretty and perfectly drawn circles but circles of nervousness, worry and fear. <br> <br> His name is Bo, he is afraid of saying something embarrassing, of being in social situations, and heights. He suffers from intense sweating and chest pains. Give him a little time to adjust and he will try and make the best out of his day even though it will scare him a lot.  <br> <h4> Bo - Social Anxiety Disorder </h4> " 

  var4="Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder affects mostly kids and teens, this makes them fidgety and easily distracted. The main symptom of ADHD is being unable to pay attention. It may be hard to listen to someone, follow directions, finish a task or keep track of stuff. <br> <br> Rito has had ADHD since the age of 2, he gets bored easily and loves jumping on beds. He daydreams a lot, almost every second. He talks a lot and finds it really hard to socialize with quite people or being in quite places. Never give him candy or anything sugary or he might never get off your bed. <br> <h4> Rito - ADHD </h4>"

  var5="Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder is a type of mental illness in which a person has severe compulsions and obsessions with the need to repeat them over and over again. These obsessions and compulsions can range from washing your hands every two minutes or to ordering every single colored pencil from longest to smallest as well as from black to yellow. This plush toy is my own personal immortalization of what OCD is to me. <br> <br> His name is Ocho which means Eight (8) in spanish, an even number, and he has eight white parts. He loves everything that comes in pairs of two. He hates his nose, mouth and belly button because he only has one of each. Every time he goes out he protects his hands, ears, legs and feet just in case they get dirty or catch something. <br> <h4> Ocho - Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder </h4>"

  var6="Impulse Control Disorder is the failure to resist something such as a temptation, urge or impulse. There are different types of impulses and they can be set from drug addiction to Pyromania to Internet Addiction. <br> <br> His name is Umo, he has become tiny and a little dumb because of all of his different addictions. He is not good at all when it comes to decision making, you can say he goes through a lot of peer pressure and always ends up doing things that can harm him. His body has become his brain which isn't functioning that well and his eyes have gone lifeless. The only good thing is that he does not have a gambling addiction or else he would've even gambled his body away. <br> <h4> Umo - Impulse Control Disorder </h4>"
