<p id='p03'>The Marvel Cinematic Universe is a shared universe created by Marvel Studios, designated as Earth-199999 within Marvel's multiverse system. The universe is comprised mainly by films independently made by Marvel Studios, that are always set within this same universe, much like Marvel has done with their comics.

<br>The universe includes a series of short films, called Marvel One-Shots, launched with each film's Blu-ray release starting with Thor and finishing with Thor: The Dark World. These short films were, however, eventually discontinued.</p>

<div id='div2'>
<p id='p04'>The franchise also includes a series of tie-in Comics and video games, released as promotional material to the films, all set within the same reality. </p>
